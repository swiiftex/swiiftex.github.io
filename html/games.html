    <h3><u>VENATOR</u></h3>
    <p>VENATOR (formerly Project Smackstick) is a multiplayer melee slasher created from the ground up to have adaptable, smooth, and skill-based combat with fun gamemodes. As of now, I am the only developer on the project and I have been using it to test mechanics, game balance, aswell as using industry standard practices for multiplayer, including using network checks for each action to prevent cheating.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The game is currently in pre-alpha and is currently in closed testing. To learn more, join the discord <a href="http://discord.io/VENATOR">here.</a></a></p>
