    <h2><u>Broadcast Tool</u></h2>
	<p>The Broadcast Tool was a project I started in 2020, originally to help my friend to create a broadcast package for OBS, for <a href="https://www.redshiftvr.online/video">a LAN event in the United States.</a> It is used to set team names and logos into a hosted HTML file; the team names are picked from a Google Sheet. The tool displayed the teams, had the ability to swap sides with 1 button, and also originally allowed the broadcast package to be automagically installed, instead of having to drag/drop the files in OBS. This is important as often at LAN events, the computer being used is not your home computer, so you need a package to be portable so that you are able to use it on other machines. This worked by editing the JSON file that OBS uses to save packages, primarily using find and replace. The program is written in Windows Forms and VB.NET.</p>
	<p>A few months later, Redshift announced their own LAN event, and the tool had some features added such as OBS Auto-Replay and automatic score input. To do this, I accessed Echo Arena's API (the game being broadcasted) and grabbed the scores from there.</p>
	<p>In 2022, someone in the European community for Echo Arena announced <a href="duckman.html">The Duckman LAN</a>. In this event I adapted the Broadcast Tool to use clientside python scripts instead of being hosted on an external server (every IP from the previous versions instead pointed to 127.0.0.1). We worked with the network engineers at the Carrington House Hotel where we were hosting the event, to ensure that both the game's API and that port 5005 could be accessed.</p>
	<p>The repository is private, but the instructions for installing the first revision of the tool can be found <a href="../content/programming/broadcasttool.pdf">here.</a>
